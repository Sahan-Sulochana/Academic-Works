## **About the Project**

This report has mainly discussed the design of a Finite Impulse Response(FIR) bandpass filter. This digital filter has been designed using the Fourier Transform method for given prescribed specifications. Impulse response truncation is done by using the Kaiser window technique. Getting a better understanding of the filter performance and for analyzing the filter characteristic, input, and output figures of the time domain and frequency domain can be used. Project implementation and filter designing the project was done by using MATLAB (R2018a) software. After the software implementation, comparing the rectangular window technique and Kaiser window technique can be done using obtained figures.
